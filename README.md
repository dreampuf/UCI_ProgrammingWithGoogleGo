# Programming with Google Go Specialization

This repository contains all home assignment of [UCI's Programming with Google Go](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/google-golang). 

The whole specializations are value for new Golang developer and the concurrency of programming part is indeed interesting. 

I'd recommend it to you.
